# Instructor Notes

A presentation to accompany these labs is available on (Prezi)[http://prezi.com/bonzhtuceyc4/intro-to-arduino/?kw=view-bonzhtuceyc4&rc=ref-29668303].  It goes through Arduino 101, 201, 202, and 301.

The suggested flow for the class is as follows:

* Talk with students about background, familiarity with programming and electronics concepts
* Present background on Arduino as a platform and as a device
* Show blink sketch
* Present Digital I/0 concepts
* Walk students through Lab 1, have them complete it on their own
* Present Analog output concepts 
* Show how the circuit diagram for Lab 2 is minimally different from Lab 1
* Walk students through requirements for Lab 2, have them complete it on their own
* Present Analog input concepts.  This is the most difficult part of 101.  Be ready to whiteboard about how voltage dividers work, and the concept of a transfer function.
* Walk students through requirements for Lab 3, have them complete it on their own
