# What you need for this class
* A computer
* [The Arduino software](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
* [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/download/)
* An Arduino.  The duemillanueve, Uno, Uno R3, Mega, or Mega R3 are fine.  Other models may work, but the pins may be different.
* A solderless breadboard.  [Full size breadboards](https://www.adafruit.com/products/239) are nice for experimentation, but you can go with [half size](https://www.adafruit.com/products/64), [tiny](https://www.adafruit.com/products/65) or [really big](https://www.adafruit.com/products/443) if you prefer.
* An LED.  Any color is fine, just make sure you don't buy surface mount components.  [I like blue](https://www.adafruit.com/products/780).
* 1 220 ohm and 1 10K ohm resistor.  You can either buy these by value or get an assortment.
* A photoresistor [This one from Adafruit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/161) works.
* A momentary switch or button. I like [these](https://www.adafruit.com/products/367), but [these colored ones](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1009) are fun.  Just make sure they will work with your breadboard.
* A Standard-A to Standard-B USB cable (squarish male on one end, rectangular male on the other)
* 10 or 15 jumper wires. [This bundle](http://www.adafruit.com/products/153) has enough for most small-scale prototypes.
## Packages
You can buy packages that come with all of these components and more.  [This kit](http://www.adafruit.com/products/170) comes with everything you will need, including the Arduino Uno R3.
# What you should know before you start
This class assumes you know a little bit about programming and a little bit about electronics.  You should be able to do the following:
* Understand what the pseudocode below does.
    a = 10;
	b = 20;

	b = a;

	print b;

* Read the schematic below.
  ![Schematic](https://raw.github.com/MakerspaceModules/arduino/master/101%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Arduino/Documentation/Button.png)
* Explain what happens when you push the button depicted in the schematic.

To learn how to do those things, take the Electronics 101 and Programming 101 classes.
