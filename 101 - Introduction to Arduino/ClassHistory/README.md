# Class History

This class originated at Workshop 88.

## Pre 2013 - Russ Lankenau, Workshop 88

Location - Workshop 88, 15'x20' classroom. 

Attendees - 3-10, ages 8-50+

Duration - 2-3 hours

### Notes

We taught this class between 2011 and 2013 for various audiences.  The most successful classes had a student:instructor ratio between 4:1 and 6:1.  Before Arduino 1.0 (the IDE) came out, the most common problem was issues installing the software.

#### What works well
* Have extra supplies (220 ohm and 10K resistors, LEDs, buttons, breadboards, jumpers) available.  These aren't that expensive, and somebody will be missing components.

## February 2013 - Andrew Morrison, Workshop 88

Location - Workshop 88, 15'x20' classroom. 

Attendees - 3, 2 adult, 1 child (age ~10)

Duration - 2 hours, 15 minutes

### Notes

Discussion during the introduction part of the class was surprisingly low-level. Attendees were interested in chip architecture more than most 101 classes. Had to rush through some of the exercises and skipped over the first PWM lab.
