## Pre 2013 - Russ Lankenau, Workshop 88

### Notes

We taught this class between 2011 and 2013 for various audiences.  The most successful classes had a student:instructor ratio between 4:1 and 6:1.  Before Arduino 1.0 (the IDE) came out, the most common problem was issues installing the software.

#### What works well
* Have extra supplies (220 ohm and 10K resistors, LEDs, buttons, breadboards, jumpers) available.  These aren't that expensive, and somebody will be missing components.
