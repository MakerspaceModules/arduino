= Instructor Notes

A presentation to accompany these labs is available on [Prezi](http://prezi.com/bonzhtuceyc4/intro-to-arduino/?kw=view-bonzhtuceyc4&rc=ref-29668303).  It goes through Arduino 101, 201, 202, and 301.  The instructor is typically required to diagnose hardware issues, so make sure you are familiar with the labs and know how to analyze a circuit.  The software is provided, but have a few ideas about how a student could take extra steps for each lab if they finish early.  These can also be assigned as homework if you would like the course to be taught over a few sessions.

This class typically takes around 2 hours.

## Suggested class flow

### Before students arrive
* Print out handouts under Documentation/Handouts/
* Have at least one copy of the Arduino 101 cheatsheet ready. (To be created)
### During class
* Make sure students have taken Arduino 101.  If more than one student has not taken the preceding class, spend a bit more time on review.
* Review the concepts in Arduino 101, going over the Arduino 101 handout if necessary.
* Talk about digital sensors as an abstraction of a simple button.  Show examples of other digital sensors (hall effect, reed sensor, tilt sensor, door sensor, switch)
* Have the students do the first lab, using whatever digital sensor they have provided. (This may need to change if this presents problems)
* Talk about simple analog sensors as an abstraction of a potentiometer.  Diagram on the board how a voltage divider works, and how you can use this to read resistance-based sensors.
* Have the students do the second lab, using a photocell.
* Talk about more complex analog sensors that can simply be read as an output voltage.  Show how detailed readings can be output via the serial port.
* Have the students read a TMP36 or similar sensor and output its value to the serial monitor.
