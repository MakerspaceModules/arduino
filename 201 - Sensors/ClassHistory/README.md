Instructor - Russ Lankenau

Location - Workshop 88, Glen Ellyn, IL

Organization - Workshop 88

Attendees - 6

Duration - 2 hours

### Notes

Several of the students had not had Arduino 101, so I combined 101 and 201 into a single class.  The class was a bit rushed, but most students were able to complete a digital(button, IR sensor) and analog (photocell) sensor lab.
